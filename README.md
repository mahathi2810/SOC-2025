# SOC-2025
In this project, we explore Reinforcement Learning by doing weekly tasks, assignments, and writing code in Python.
# Week 1: Python and Game Development
In the first week, I revised the basics of Python, like loops, functions, classes, and object-oriented programming (OOP). I used websites like W3Schools and TutorialsPoint to go over the concepts. After that, I started learning Pygame, which is a library in Python used to create games. I followed tutorials and videos to build a simple Snake Game. This helped me apply the Python concepts I learned and understand how games work in terms of logic and design.
# Week 2: Neural Networks and CNNs
In week two, I started learning about neural networks. I watched the 3Blue1Brown videos, which gave me a clear and visual understanding of how neural networks learn. I also explored activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid. Then, I moved on to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are used for image processing. Andrew Ng’s course and YouTube videos helped me a lot here. I also learned the basics of PyTorch and how to build a simple neural network using it. I explored transfer learning too, which is useful when we want to reuse a model trained on one task for a new, similar task.
# Week 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
This week was all about reinforcement learning. I learned that RL is about training an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize rewards. I studied concepts like states, actions, rewards, and policies. David Silver’s lectures were very helpful, and I also read some parts of the Sutton and Barto RL book. I didn’t have a coding assignment this week, but I made notes to understand how RL works and how it’s different from supervised learning.
# Week 4: Deep Q-Learning and DQNs
In the fourth week, I focused on deep Q-learning, which is a mix of reinforcement learning and deep learning. I learned how neural networks can be used to estimate Q-values (expected rewards). I also studied things like experience replay and target networks, which help improve learning and training stability. I watched videos and read articles to understand how Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) work and when they are used. This week helped me understand how we can apply RL to real-world problems using deep learning models.
